#You can prepend a pattern with a double asterisk to match directories anywhere in the repository

#You can also use a double asterisk to match files based on their name and the name of their parent directory.

#An asterisk is a wildcard that matches zero or more characters.

#Prepending an exclamation mark to a pattern negates it. If a file matches a pattern, but also matches a negating pattern defined later in the file, it will not be ignored.

#Patterns defined after a negating pattern will re-ignore any previously negated files.

#Prepending a slash matches files only in the repository root.

#A question mark matches exactly one character.

#Square brackets can also be used to match a single character from a specified range.

#If you don't append a slash, the pattern will match both files and the contents of directories with that name. In the example matches on the left, both directories and files named logs are ignored

#Patterns specifying a file in a particular directory are relative to the repository root. (You can prepend a slash if you like, but it doesn't do anything special.)
